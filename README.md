Some backend technologies are not strange to me either since I am a graduate of Green Fox Academy boot camp, where we studied Java, Spring Boot, or I worked on team full stack project ([final presentation here](https://youtu.be/TYvwSEom6s8)).

Topics of corporate processes and finance are close to me due to my previous experience from finance, especially in financial controlling, and daily work on ERP development.

Since I find learning fun and often try to broaden my knowledge, my github can contain various repos that were used for learning purposes within online courses. Finished courses can be always found on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roman-n%C3%A9meth-646a40b8/).
